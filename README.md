# ML Implementation Insights

This repository is aiming to show how to implement neural network from scratch
along with diving into the math behind.

**ml-impl-insights** is a repository dedicated to demonstrating how to implement fundamental neural networks from scratch while diving deeply into the underlying mathematics. Each module in the repository tackles a specific concept so that you can follow along and learn how these models really work under the hood.

## Overview
Implementing neural networks from scratch can be incredibly valuable for:
- Gaining a deeper understanding of the math and theory behind them.
- Debugging and optimizing models at a low level.
- Exploring variations of standard architectures to see their effect on performance.

This repository includes:
- **Word2Vec (CBOW w/ Softmax)**: Implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) variant.
- **Word2Vec (Skip-Gram w/ Negative Sampling)**: Implementation of the Continuous Skip-Gram variant.
- *(Future modules)* Additional examples and mathematical explorations of other network architectures and NLP concepts.

## Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. Make sure you have Poetry installed, then run:

```sh
poetry install
```

---

## How to run

Once youâ€™ve installed the dependencies and activated the virtual environment, you can run the CBOW example with:

```sh
poetry run python src/Word2Vec/CBOW.py
```
